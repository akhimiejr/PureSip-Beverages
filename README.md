# 1.1 Overview
PureSip Beverages is a growing beverage distribution company supplying popular brands such as Coke, Fanta, Sprite, and other leading soft drinks to major retailers including Costco, Walgreens, Target, and Walmart. As the organisation expanded, sales reporting became increasingly fragmented due to reliance on separate spreadsheets managed by regional managers. To address challenges related to data consolidation, reporting accuracy, and analytical capability, PureSip implemented a Power BI solution using a centralised folder connection and automated refresh, enabling real-time visibility of performance across all locations.
# 1.2 Aim of the Project
The objective of the project was to modernise PureSip’s reporting infrastructure by replacing manual spreadsheet-based reporting with an automated, scalable, and interactive analytics environment. The project aimed to integrate sales data from all regional managers into a centralised system using Power BI folder connections, improve data consistency and accuracy, and provide an analytical platform capable of delivering actionable insights on sales trends, retailer performance, and product-level contribution.
